# Scripts to filter Network Event logs

Scripts in this folder can be used to filter the network event logs that you can generate from the Reports screen in the Settings of your Twingate Admin Console.

## Prerequisites

You should only need Python 3 for these scripts, as they use the `sys` and `csv` built-in modules only.

## Usage

Check each script for instructions on usage.
